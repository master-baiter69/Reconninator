This generic approach for bug bounty hunting with a focus on subdomains involves the following steps:
    
    > Gathering subdomains from various sources and consolidating them into a single output file.
    > Filtering in-scope subdomains from a subdomain database using specified patterns.
    > Creating a domain file with only the in-scope subdomains for further analysis.
    > Verifying that there are no out-of-scope subdomains in the domain file.
    > Separating the in-scope subdomains from the complete list of subdomains for targeted hunting.
    > Removing any duplicate domains or subdomains from the list.
